A useful example is the sin function. There are many, many reasons why one might want to take the sin of something, so it is useful to define the sin function once and for all so that any program that needs to take the sin can do so, rather than having to come up with their own approximation of the sin using a Taylor expansion, etc.\n","\n","The capability that we are seeking is provided by defining new functions. This allows us to make our own functions that are just like the sin function, and can be called in a similar way. Functions are defined by the following syntax:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"92E6D45FkfbG","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1725565566121,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":231,"user":{"displayName":"Ryogo Katahira","userId":"09574970927263593683"}}},"source":["def myfunc(arg1, arg2):\n","    print(\"I am a function!

Let's walk through this declaration step by step:\n","The first line begins with def, then the name of the function, and then in parentheses a list of arguments for the function, then a colon. Arguments are inputs to the function. For example, the sin function takes an angle as an argument. In this example our function has two arguments. The number of arguments is arbitrary, and can be zero, in which case the parentheses are just left empty. It is also possible to write functions where the number of arguments is variable, and need not be the same every time the function is called, but we won't discuss that capability further in this short course.  \n","\n","After the define line, we begin the body of the function. Note that all the lines in the function body are indented. This indentation is IMPORTANT. In python, indentation is used to indicate that a particular line belongs to a particular function, loop, or other block of code. All the lines of the function are indented four spaces. If you're using entering this manually in ipython, either at the command line or in the notebook, you don't need to type in those four spaces by hand; the ipython shell will automatically enter them for you after seeing the def line. If you're using emacs as a text editor, you can just hit the tab key and the correct number of spaces will be entered for you.  \n","\n","Within the body of the function, we can enter whatever commands we like. We can print things, for example. The arguments in that appeared in parentheses in the definition are accessible within the function, and can be manipulated however we like.  \n","\n","At the end of the function, we have a statement that begins return. A return function causes the function to give back a value, which the calling program can print, assign to a variable, or do something else with. For example the sin function returns the sin of the input angle. Return values are optional: functions don't have to return anything, and can just end."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zoKyWq2lkfbK"},"source":["OK, with that in mind, let's try defining this function"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ETSerEzjkfbK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1725565566406,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":37,"user":{"displayName":"Ryogo Katahira","userId":"09574970927263593683"}}},"source":["def myfunc(arg1, arg2):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    This is a function that does nothing in particular\n","    \"\"\"\n","    print(\"I am a function!
